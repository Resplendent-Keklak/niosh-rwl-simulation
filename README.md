# niosh-rwl-simulation
This repository contains a compilation of programs that can simulate the ![National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)](https://cdc.gov/niosh/) Recommended Weight Limit (RWL) calculations using the revised RWL formula. As it is constructed simulations with more programming languages will be added. The project may also expand to a larger scope (e.g. including simulations involving different formulae and standards, a GUI for entering data into the simulations, etc.) in the future once all the major programming languages are covered.

# Roadmap
## Feature Requirements for Each Implementation
- Client input of data that is passed to the RWL formula
- Ability for client to view results of a simulated lift
- Ability for client to pass multiple data and collect results of multiple simulated lifts simultaneously
- Reports saved to .txt and .md formats
